In the project what was tried was to export certain Neo4j specific graph algorithms in the realm of Python where these are free of costs and use those topological features in creating context that realises personalized recommandations for the users in the different databases.

I initially have inserted only 20k inside in order to test the how I can correctly run the graph algorithms and then after I do more injection of 10k-20ks at a time to see how well I can scale the model without having it rot. And as such it really worked
